        <h4>Samantha Brandeberry</h4>

        I am currently an Academic Advisor at the University of Missouri-Columbia, where I specialize in assisting students who have no chosen a major. I help these students explore their interests, passions and skills so they can discover the right career path for them. One of my key roles is designing and teaching a course for my new students every fall, which helps them jump start their major and career exploration process.
        I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Human Environmental Science from the University of Arkansas and a Master’s degree in Educational Leadership from the University of South Alabama. I am currently earning my second Master’s degree in Learning Technologies and Design from the University of Missouri and expect to graduate in December 2025.
        I am passionate about using creative and interactive ways to make learning more engaging for students. My goal is to continue developing new educational tools that can help students achieve their academic, personal and career goals.
