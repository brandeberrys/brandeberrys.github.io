   <p class="intro">
    I believe the purpose of advising is to provide students with a guide during their academic journey. An academic advisor should listen, be knowledgeable, be adaptable and be empathic. Throughout my career in higher education, I have learned that success looks different to all students. Many come in knowing exactly what they want to pursue and how they will get there. However, most will need guidance as they discover more specific interests of theirs and develop deeper passions. </p>
    <p class ="indent">
    College will be an exciting and terrifying time for many students. It is a rollercoaster of decisions, opportunities, and mistakes. My philosophy is that there is no shame in taking time to find the right major or career path for you, but without the right guidance, students waste precious time and money on courses and experiences that will ultimately, not aid them in completing their degree. Students who effectively connect with an advisor can successfully explore new interests and form a comprehensive academic plan. </p>
    <p class ="indent">When I advise students, I aspire to see them as a whole person because what goes on at home, socially and with their health effects how they do in the classroom. While I cannot fix barriers to their success for them, I can listen and connect them with resources that may aid them in their journey. It is up to them to utilize campus and community resources, but knowledge that they exist in the first place is paramount. I can do my due diligence by familiarizing myself with campus resources and building connections across campus. </p>
    <p class ="indent">Freshmen college students are a passion area for me. As a freshman in college, my advisors helped guide me through a discovery phase, which led me to the path of study that I ended up pursing. Schlossberg’s Transition Theory guides my approach for supporting students who are transitioning. Transition to college is a major one for first-year students. Through advising and referral, I aim to positively impact students’ ability to cope with the transition by providing them with social support and strategies that help them to cope. </p>
    <p class ="indent">Advising matters because academic is a big place. Requirements and courses change often, and it helps students to have a sounding board who can help them identify issues in completing their degree before the issues are severe and who can help them strategically plan which courses to take in what sequence throughout their academic journey. </p>
    <p class ="indent">As a member of the advising community, I think it is important to embrace being a lifelong learner in pursuit of more effective connections with students. As a professional, it is easy to get caught up in the day-to-day work and let professional development become a second thought. Intentionally setting aside time to read journal articles, to learn from colleagues and to be fully present during professional development seminars takes effort, but ultimately makes us better advocates for our students. </p>
   <h2>Career Goals</h2>
   <p class="intro">
   I aspire to grow and learn with and from my students as a life-long learner. For me, that means pursuing opportunities to design technology and experiences that will enhance learning for students in this digital age. I hope to someday pivot into a project development role, applying my design skills and informed by my experiences in higher education.
